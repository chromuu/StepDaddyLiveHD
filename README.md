# StepDaddyLiveHD 🚀

A self-hosted IPTV proxy built with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev), enabling you to watch over 1,000 📺 TV channels and search for live events or sports matches ⚽🏀. Stream directly in your browser 🌐 or through any media player client 🎶. You can also download the entire playlist (`playlist.m3u8`) and integrate it with platforms like Jellyfin 🍇 or other IPTV media players.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📱 Stream Anywhere**: Watch TV channels on any device via the web or media players.
- **📄 Playlist Integration**: Download the `playlist.m3u8` and use it with Jellyfin or any IPTV client.
- **⚙️ Customizable Hosting**: Host the application locally or deploy it via Docker with various configuration options.
- **m3u8 Stream Extraction Caching**: Improves network latency from few seconds to sub 1 second. This is useful when running the container behind vpn e.g. gluetun

## 🐳 Docker Installation (Recommended)

> ⚠️ **Important:** If you plan to use this application across your local network (LAN), you must set `API_URL` to the **local IP address** of the device hosting the server in `.env`.

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
3. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Plain Docker:
```bash
docker build -t step-daddy-live-hd .
docker run -p 3535:3535 step-daddy-live-hd
```

---

## 🖥️ Local Installation

1. Install Python 🐍 (tested with version 3.13).
2. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Plaza4756/StepDaddyLiveHD
   cd StepDaddyLiveHD
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **PORT**: Set a custom front end (web ui) port for the server.
- **API_URL**: Set the domain or IP where the server is reachable.
- **SOCKS5**: Proxy DLHD traffic through a SOCKS5 server if needed.
- **PROXY_CONTENT**: Proxy video content itself through your server (optional). Leave it as TRUE to avoid any CORS errors while fetching the stream. When it is FALSE, players fetch video segments straight from the CDN, so the server can't see a segment rejected for an expired token. Expiry is then caught when the player next reloads the channel's playlist (or its key), which the server re-resolves on the spot.
- **BACKEND_PORT**: Custom backend port for the server. Useful when running behind vpn (e.g. gluetun) and there is a port conflict. Leave unchanged otherwise.
- **IMPERSONATE**: Browser TLS fingerprint used by `curl_cffi` for upstream requests (default `chrome136`). If streams start returning 403 again, try another profile (e.g. `chrome131`, `safari184`) without rebuilding.
- **URL_SECRET**: Any long random string. Keeps proxied stream links valid across redeploys, so players don't break when the container is recreated. If unset, a key is generated once and stored in `.url_key`, which survives restarts but not a recreated container.

Edit the `.env` for docker compose.

### Example Docker Command
```bash
docker build --build-arg PROXY_CONTENT=FALSE --build-arg API_URL=https://example.com --build-arg SOCKS5=user:password@proxy.example.com:1080 -t step-daddy-live-hd .
docker run -e PROXY_CONTENT=FALSE -e API_URL=https://example.com -e SOCKS5=user:password@proxy.example.com:1080 -p 3535:3535 step-daddy-live-hd
```
